# WebDev_Resume
Building a resume whilst learning webdev

I am beginning a new journey with this project. I've also been interested in markup languages or coding but I never knew where to start or what I wanted out of it. I've tried to learn Python several times now and I was able to learn basic syntax and the bare minimum of it all. The issue was that I didn't know how to apply it to my life. Everything I wanted to do was either too advanced or not applicable. I understand, walk before you run. Trust me I tried. 

I am also (I say loosely) an artist. I am very interested in 3D modelling and have been using Blender3D for some time now. I wouldn't consider myself an expert, nor even intermediate at it but I able to create scenes that I liked and have been able to learn a bit overtime. I've dabbled in HTML before, back when codeacademy was free to use (mostly) but it nver went passed that. It was until I combined everything I was interested in and asked ChatGPT, "I like to do art, between WebDev and Python, what would be a better path for someone like me?" I think I already knew the answer but wanted the reasoning, basically that WebDev would be a better fit and I could expand into other languages once I've become proficient. Because I can sylize webpages and can see the immediate changes based on a single line of "code" (I know, HTML isn't a programming language).

Once that was determined, I once again asked ChatGPT for two things: 
  1) A free study plan with no deadline in mind.
  2) An easy project that I can build upon as I learn more.

The perfect answer... a resume! Easy to HTML, fun to CSS, and then make it functional with some JavaScript. On top of that, if I decide to switch jobs, this may be a great project to stand out. When they ask me for the resume, I'll hand them an entire, well put-together, website. 

So, one central location to hold it all. Update as I go until I have something I am confortable with sharing.
